/**
 * Bank Requests
 *
 * You've been asked to program a bot for a popular bank that will automate the management of incoming requests. There are three types of requests the bank can receive:
 *  transfer i j sum: request to transfer sum amount of money from the ith account to the jth one;
 *  deposit i sum: request to deposit sum amount of money in the ith account;
 *  withdraw i sum: request to withdraw sum amount of money from the ith account.
 *
 * Your bot should also be able to process invalid requests. There are two types of invalid requests:
 *      invalid account number in the requests;
 *      deposit / withdrawal of a larger amount of money than is currently available.
 *
 * For the given list of accounts and requests, return the state of accounts after all requests have been processed, or an array of a single element [-<request_id>]
 * (please note the minus sign), where <request_id> is the 1-based index of the first invalid request.
 *
 * Example
 *  For accounts = [10, 100, 20, 50, 30] and requests = ["withdraw 2 10", "transfer 5 1 20", "deposit 5 20", "transfer 3 4 15"],
 *  the output should be bankRequests(accounts, requests) = [30, 90, 5, 65, 30].
 *
 *  Here are the states of accounts after each request:
 *      "withdraw 2 10": [10, 90, 20, 50, 30];
 *      "transfer 5 1 20": [30, 90, 20, 50, 10];
 *      "deposit 5 20": [30, 90, 20, 50, 30];
 *      "transfer 3 4 15": [30, 90, 5, 65, 30], which is the answer.
 *
 *  For accounts = [20, 1000, 500, 40, 90] and requests = ["deposit 3 400", "transfer 1 2 30", "withdraw 4 50"],
 *  the output should be bankRequests(accounts, requests) = [-2].
 *
 *  After the first request, accounts becomes equal to [20, 1000, 900, 40, 90], but the second one turns it into [-10, 1030, 900, 40, 90], which is invalid.
 *  Thus, the second request is invalid, and the answer is [-2]. Note that the last request is also invalid, but it shouldn't be included in the answer.
